Indeed, since the start of 2018-19, this is the fewest defeats any side to face the Red Devils 3+ times in the competition has had against them. Manchester United are winless in their last nine Premier League games at Anfield since a 1-0 win in January 2016 under Louis van Gaal. Liverpool could become just the second side to avoid defeat in 10+ successive Premier League home games against the Red Devils, after Chelsea.
